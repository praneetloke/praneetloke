I love working on distributed cloud services and tinkering on various things. I have worked on various problems in my career ranging from creating a questionnaire application written from scratch using Pega BPM (a long time ago!) to working on a high-performance in-product messaging service capable of delivering messages to millions of users around the world (with impression capping rules!) to working on developer tooling that makes [cloud infrastructure](https://www.pulumi.com) the same as any other application you write.

My most recent creation is a browser extension that can help protect your privacy, especially when you are sharing your screen during a Zoom call! Download for free today:
